Your program takes up to four optional arguments, which are used to set program parameters. Forsimplicity, we will assume any argument that begins with a dash (-) specifies an option. The firstcharacter following the dash indicates which parameter is being specified, and the remainder of theargument gives the value for that parameter. Table 1 gives the syntax for the four options, and thedefault values for the parameters of the options are omitted.For simplicity, you may require all optional arguments to occur before the regular argumentsin the argument list, or allow them to be intermixed. You may require that an optional argumentoccur at most once, or allow later arguments to override earlier ones.You must allow options to be given in any order.Your program must detect any invalid optional arguments and halt with an error message.Possible errors are an invalid option (e.g.,-x), or an invalid or missing argument (e.g.,-f0or-d).


            Thefrequencyof a word is the number of times the word appears divided by the total number ofwords. For example, in the text “spam eggs bacon spam”, the frequency of “spam” is 0.5, and thefrequencies of “eggs” and “bacon” are both 0.25.Theword frequency distribution(WFD) for a file is a list of every word that occurs at least oncein the file, along with its frequency. Ignoring rounding errors, the frequencies for all the words willadd up to 1.
