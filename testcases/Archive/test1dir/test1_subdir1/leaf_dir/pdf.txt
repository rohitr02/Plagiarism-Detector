In this example, the arguments arefoo(a file) andbar(a directory). One file inbarmatchesthe default suffix (".txt") and is added to the file set. The subdirectorybar/spamis also traversed,and its files that end with the suffix are added. This results in the file setfoo,bar/baz.txt, andbar/spam/eggs.txt. (Note thatfoodoes not need to end with the suffix, because it was explicitlygiven by the user.)For each pair of files in the file set, the program outputs the JSD and the (path) names of thefiles being compared. Comparisons are printed in decreasing order of combined word count (that is,the total number of words in both files). Note that pairs are unordered, so the output will includecomparisons offooandbar/baz.txtorbar/baz.txtandfoo, but not both.
